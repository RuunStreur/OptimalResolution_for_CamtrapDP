## Data Context

Due to the nature of the project this EDA will slightly defer from the standard Data Science EDA (provided by https://www.kaggle.com/code/ekami66/detailed-exploratory-data-analysis-with-python ). In this EDA the basic structure of the CamtrapDP standard format for Camera Trap data will be elaborated upon, and our personal dataset from the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam will be analysed. <br>
Camera Trap Data Package (or Camtrap DP for short) is a community developed data exchange format for camera trap data. A Camtrap DP is a Frictionless Data Package that consists of <br>
*datapackage.json*:	Metadata about the data package and camera trap project.\
*deployments.csv*:	Table with camera trap placements (deployments).\
*media.csv*:	        Table with media files recorded during deployments.\
*observations.csv*:	Table with observations derived from the media files.\

For this EDA only the deployments and observations data will be of use.

## Observations data
Data Loading
```{r}
deployments_artis <- read.csv("../ArtisData/deployments.csv")
observations_artis <- read.csv("../ArtisData/observations.csv")

deployments_artis$deploymentStart <- as.Date(deployments_artis$deploymentStart)
deployments_artis$deploymentEnd <- as.Date(deployments_artis$deploymentEnd)

```

\newpage
A slice of the dataframe observations_artis:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(observations_artis[120:123, 0:3])
knitr::kable(observations_artis[120:123, 4:7])
knitr::kable(observations_artis[120:123, 8:13])
knitr::kable(observations_artis[120:123, 14:19])
knitr::kable(observations_artis[120:123, 20:22])

```

NaN Analysis
```{r}
 
colSums(is.na(observations_artis))
```
As we can see many columns contain a lot of NaN entries, most notably 'classificationProbability', 'individualID', 'behavior' with only NaN entries and all the bbox columns are mostly empty. The other columns, although not all complete, contain information that might be interesting.

Column explanations:

Amount of different species:

  distinct(scientificName) %>%  
  nrow() 
cat("Number of different species observed:", num_species, "\n")

```
NaN Analysis:
```{r}
colSums(is.na(deployments_artis))
```
As we can see not many columns contain NaN entries, only 'locationID', 'habitatType', 'doploymentTags' and 'deploymentComments' with only NaN entries.
We have 21 different camera deployments in our dataset.

Now it would be interesting to look at the deployment locations of the individual cameras:
```{r, echo=T, results='hide'}
deployments_artis$time_active <- deployments_artis$deploymentEnd - deployments_artis$deploymentStart
deployments_artis$time_active <- as.numeric(deployments_artis$time_active)

locations <- deployments_artis[c("deploymentID","longitude", "latitude")]
locations_sf <- st_as_sf(locations,
                         coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                         crs = 4326)

locations_basemap <- get_tiles(locations_sf, provider = "Esri.WorldTopoMap")
# plot(locations_basemap)
# plot(locations_sf, col = "red", pch = 16, add =T)
```
![](Plots/CameraLocationsMapArtis.png)
Summarizing the distances between cameras:
```{r}
distance_matrix <- st_distance(locations_sf)
diag(distance_matrix) <- NA
summary(as.vector(distance_matrix))
```
Now to look at the deployment duration for possible gaps:
```{r}
par(mar=c(4,8,1,1))
plot(0,
     type="n",
     xlim=c(min(deployments_artis$deploymentStart),max(deployments_artis$deploymentEnd)),
     ylim=c(1,nrow(locations)),
     yaxt="n",
     xaxt="n",
     xlab="Date",
     ylab=""
)
axis.Date(1,format="%Y-%m")
axis(2,at=c(1:nrow(locations)),labels=locations$deploymentID,las=1)
for(i in 1:nrow(deployments_artis)){
  curr_deployment = deployments_artis[i,]
  location_ind = which(locations$deploymentID==curr_deployment$deploymentID)
  lines(x=c(curr_deployment$deploymentStart,curr_deployment$deploymentEnd),
        y=c(location_ind,location_ind),
        lwd=2)
}

```


\
Adding on Observation occurences
```{r}
observations_artis$date <- as.Date(observations_artis$eventStart)

obs_deploy_index <- match(observations_artis$deploymentID,deployments_artis$deploymentID)
observations_artis$deploymentID <- deployments_artis$deploymentID[obs_deploy_index]
obs_place_ind = match(observations_artis$deploymentID,locations$deploymentID)
# points(observations_artis$date,obs_place_ind,col="red",pch=16)
```
![](Plots/CameraActivityWithObservations.png)
Seeing this plot we now know that observations stopped being annotated after the end of 2022, meaning we have no data from 2023 onwards and we can drop the upper camera since there is no observation data available.

```{r}
deployments_artis$deploymentEnd[deployments_artis$deploymentEnd > as.Date('2023-01-01')] <- as.Date('2023-01-01')
deployments_artis <- deployments_artis[deployments_artis$deploymentID != "artis_20_03272023_wildlifecamera1", ]
observations_artis <- observations_artis[observations_artis$deploymentID != "artis_20_03272023_wildlifecamera1", ]
```


Looking at the number of detections and pictures taken per deployment:
```{r}
det_per_deployment <- aggregate(
  count~deploymentID,
  FUN=sum,
  data=observations_artis)

pic_per_location<-aggregate(
  count~deploymentID,#number of objects (in a picture) BY deployment
  FUN=length,
  data=observations_artis)

combined_data <- merge(pic_per_location, det_per_deployment, by = "deploymentID", suffixes = c("_pic", "_det"))
combined_data$det_rate <- combined_data$count_det / combined_data$count_pic
combined_data$det_rate <- round(combined_data$det_rate, 2)

combined_data

```
We see that there's always less detections made than pictures taken, this means that sometimes a camera takes a picture when nothing is detected. The detection rate is the ratio of detections/picture. A low value means a camera shoots many blanks, and a high ratio means that almost wevery time a picture is taken, a detection is made.

We can also plot the amount of unique species observed against the number of days a deployment has been active:
```{r}
for(deployment_artis in deployments_artis$deploymentID){
  deployment_obs <- observations_artis$scientificName[observations_artis$deploymentID==deployment_artis]
  uni_obs <- unique(deployment_obs)
  n_uni_obs <- length(uni_obs)
  deployments_artis$n_species[deployments_artis$deploymentID==deployment_artis] <- n_uni_obs
}
plot(n_species~time_active,
     data=deployments_artis,
     #solid point symbol
     pch=16,
     #axis labels
     xlab="Days active",
     ylab="n. species detected")

```
\

From this plot we can see a vague positive correlation between the two, but it is not necesarrily what we expect. We expect a clear line with species detected increasing as days active increases, bit this isn't exactly the case. This means other factors greatly influence the amount of species detected for a deployment!
